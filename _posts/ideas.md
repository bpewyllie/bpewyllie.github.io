    * Most listened to artists (artists with the most "points" based on chart position by week)
    * Top genres
    * Top songs
    * Other cities that listened to your top artists
    * Measure the overlap in the overall top chart with the USA overall top chart

* Utah state public salaries - Transparent Utah site
* Trax data
* Reddit data -/r/SaltLakeCity vs /r/Utah
* IMDb data - movie locations
* Maxx preps high school football stats
* Utah real estate listings
* Local coffee roasters ethics scores - fob (free on board) rankings
* Politics - opensecrets
  * follow the money
  * cost to buy a local politican

* Tools to try:
  * Streamlit
  * Power BI
  * Dagster
  * QGIS / ArcGIS
