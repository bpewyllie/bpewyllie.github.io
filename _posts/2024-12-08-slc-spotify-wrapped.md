In honor of Spotify Wrapped 2024 releasing recently, I used the [Spotify Local Charts](https://charts.spotify.com/charts/overview/global) to create one for Salt Lake City.

# Dataset

All data can be easily retrieved from the [Spotify Charts website](https://charts.spotify.com/charts/overview/global). This site shows the top 100 songs for select local markets each week of the year. For each market, there are two different types of charts that Spotify offers:

1. **Top Tracks** - a weekly ranking of the most played songs in the selected market

2. **Local Pulse** - a weekly ranking of the "top songs that are uniquely popular" in the selected market

I downloaded the data from the first week of the year (January 4) through the most recent week (December 5) to summarize the data for SLC's "Wrapped." 

To determine the top artists and songs of the year, I calculated a "score" for each song based on its weekly ranking in the charts. The score is equal to the inverse of the song's ranking, so a song ranked 100th would receive a score of 1 that week and a song ranked 1st would receive a score of 100. Summing the weekly scores up, I calculated an aggregate score for each song and artist that appeared on the charts at any point in the year.
